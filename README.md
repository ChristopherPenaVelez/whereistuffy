# Where Is Tuffy?

Welcome to "Where Is Tuffy?"â€”the interactive web game that takes you on a virtual scavenger hunt across the CSUF campus!

## Overview

"Where Is Tuffy?" is a browser-based game designed for students, alumni, and anyone interested in CSUF. Based on the concept of GeoGuessr, this game presents you with images from various locations around campus, and your challenge is to guess where they were taken. Test your campus knowledge and see how well you know CSUF!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Navigate to the homepage and click on 'Play' to begin your guessing adventure.
2. **Examine the Clues:** A random image from the campus will be presented. Look around for any clues that might indicate where you are.
3. **Make Your Guess:** Use the integrated Google Map to pinpoint the location where you think the image was captured. The closer you are, the higher your score!
4. **Submit Your Guess:** Once you're confident, hit 'Submit Guess' to see how well you did.
